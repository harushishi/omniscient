This is a project im trying to build on my free time, with the purpose to properly learn a new stack. It's being made with TypeScript, Nextjs and Tailwind. The idea behind it is to allow users to transfer their playlists across multiple platforms, i.e: spotify to youtubeMusic or viceversa. Currently the scope is limited to this two platforms, with the idea to expand to Apple Music (which they're API is paywalled so it'll have to wait due to economical difficulties) and in the future maybe to more platforms.

Still a Work in progress! I'd love to have more time to progress faster on it but currently I don't. :(
